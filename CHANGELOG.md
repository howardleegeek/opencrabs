# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenCrab will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **3-Tier Memory System** -- OpenCrabs now has a layered memory architecture: (1) **Brain MEMORY.md** -- user-curated durable memory loaded into system brain every turn, (2) **Daily Memory Logs** -- auto-compaction summaries saved to `~/.opencrabs/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with multiple compactions per day stacking in the same file, (3) **Memory Search** -- `memory_search` tool backed by QMD for semantic search across all past daily logs
- **Memory Search Tool** -- New `memory_search` agent tool searches past conversation logs via QMD (`qmd query --json`); gracefully degrades if QMD is not installed, returning a hint to use `read_file` on daily logs directly
- **Compaction Summary Display** -- Auto-compaction at 80% context now shows the full summary in chat as a system message instead of running silently; users see exactly what the agent remembered
- **Scroll While Streaming** -- Users can scroll up during streaming without being yanked back to the bottom; `auto_scroll` flag disables on user scroll, re-enables when scrolled back to bottom or on message send
- **QMD Auto-Index** -- After each compaction, `qmd update` is triggered in the background to keep the memory search index current
- **Memory Module** -- New `src/memory/mod.rs` module with QMD wrapper: availability check, collection management, search, and background re-indexing
- **Path Consolidation** -- All data now lives under `~/.opencrabs/` (config, database, brain, memory, history, logs)
- **Context Budget Awareness** -- Tool definition overhead (~500 tokens per tool) now factored into context usage calculation, preventing "prompt too long" errors

### Changed
- **Compaction Target** -- Compaction summaries now write to daily logs (`~/.opencrabs/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) instead of appending to brain workspace `MEMORY.md`; brain `MEMORY.md` remains user-curated and untouched by auto-compaction
- **Local Timestamps** -- Daily memory logs use `chrono::Local` instead of UTC for human-readable timestamps

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Cursor Navigation** -- Full cursor movement in input: Left/Right arrows, Ctrl+Left/Right word jump, Home/End, Delete key, Backspace at cursor position, word delete (Alt/Ctrl+Backspace), character and paste insertion at cursor position, cursor renders at correct position
- **Input History Persistence** -- Command history saved to `~/.config/opencrabs/history.txt` (one line per entry), loaded on startup, appended on each send, capped at 500 entries, survives restarts
- **Real-time Streaming** -- Added `stream_complete()` method that streams text chunks from the provider via `StreamingChunk` progress events, replacing the old blocking `provider.complete()` call
- **Streaming Spinner** -- Animated spinner shows `"claude-opus is responding..."` with streamed text below; `"thinking..."` spinner shows only before streaming begins
- **Inline Plan Approval** -- Plan approval now renders as an interactive inline selector with arrow keys (Approve / Reject / Request Changes / View Plan) instead of plain text Ctrl key instructions
- **Telegram Photo Support** -- Incoming photos download at largest resolution, saved to temp file, forwarded as `<<IMG:path>>` caption; image documents detected via `image/*` MIME type; temp files cleaned up after 30 seconds
- **Error Message Rendering** -- `app.error_message` is now rendered in the chat UI (was previously set but never displayed)
- **Default Model Name** -- New sessions show the actual provider model name (e.g. `claude-opus-4-6`) as placeholder instead of generic "AI"
- **Debug Logging** -- `DEBUG_LOGS_LOCATION` env var sets custom log directory; `--debug` CLI flag enables debug mode
- **8 New Tests** -- `stream_complete_text_only`, `stream_complete_with_tool_use`, `streaming_chunks_emitted`, `markdown_to_telegram_html_*`, `escape_html`, `img_marker_format` (412 total)

### Fixed
- **SSE Parser Cross-Chunk Buffering** -- TCP chunks splitting JSON events mid-string caused `EOF while parsing a string` errors and silent response drops; parser now buffers partial lines across chunks with `Arc<Mutex<String>>`, only parsing complete newline-terminated lines
- **Stale Approval Cleanup** -- Old `Pending` approval messages permanently hid streaming responses; now cleared on new message send, new approval request, and response completion
- **Approval Dialog Reset** -- `approval_auto_always` reset on session create/load; inline "Always" now sets `approval_auto_session` (resets on session change) instead of `approval_auto_always`
- **Brain File Path** -- Brain prompt builder used wrong path for workspace files
- **Abort During Streaming** -- Cancel token properly wired through streaming flow for Escape×2 abort

### Changed
- **README** -- Expanded self-sustaining section with `/rebuild` command, `SelfUpdater` module, session persistence, brain live-editing documentation

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Image Input Support** -- Paste image paths or URLs into the input; auto-detected and attached as vision content blocks for multimodal models (handles paths with spaces)
- **Attachment Indicator** -- Attached images show as `[IMG1:filename.png]` in the input box title bar; user messages display `[IMG: filename.png]`
- **Tool Context Persistence** -- Tool call groups are now saved to the database and reconstructed on session reload; no more vanishing tool history
- **Intermediate Text Display** -- Agent text between tool call batches now appears interleaved in the chat, matching Claude Code's behavior

### Fixed
- **Tool Descriptions Showing "?"** -- Approval dialog showed "Edit ?" instead of file paths; fixed parameter key mismatches (`path` not `file_path`, `operation` not `action`)
- **Raw Tool JSON in Chat** -- `[Tool: read_file]{json}` was dumped into assistant messages; now only text blocks are displayed, tool calls shown via the tool group UI
- **Loop Detection Wrong Keys** -- Tool loop detection used `file_path` for read/write/edit; fixed to `path`
- **Telegram Text+Voice Order** -- Text reply now always sent first, voice note follows (was skipping text on TTS success)

### Changed
- **base64 dependency** -- Re-added `base64 = "0.22.1"` for image encoding (was removed in dep cleanup but now needed)

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Voice Integration (STT)** -- Incoming Telegram voice notes are transcribed via Groq Whisper (`whisper-large-v3-turbo`) and processed as text by the agent
- **Voice Integration (TTS)** -- Agent replies to voice notes with audio via OpenAI TTS (`gpt-4o-mini-tts`, `ash` voice); falls back to text if TTS is disabled or fails
- **Onboarding: Telegram Setup** -- New wizard step with BotFather instructions, bot token input (masked), and user ID guidance; auto-detects existing env/keyring values
- **Onboarding: Voice Setup** -- New wizard step for Groq API key (STT) and TTS toggle with `ash` voice label; auto-detects `GROQ_API_KEY` from environment
- **Sessions Dialog: Context Info** -- `/sessions` now shows token count per session (`12.5K tok`, `2.1M tok`) and live context window percentage for the current session with color coding (green/yellow/red)
- **Tool Descriptions in Approval** -- Approval dialog now shows actual file paths and parameters (e.g. "Edit /src/tui/render.rs") instead of raw tool names ("edit_file")
- **Shared Telegram Session** -- Owner's Telegram messages now use the same session as the TUI terminal; no more separate sessions that could pick the wrong model

### Changed
- **Provider Priority** -- Factory order changed to Qwen → Anthropic → OpenAI; Anthropic is now always preferred over OpenAI for text generation
- **OPENAI_API_KEY Isolation** -- `OPENAI_API_KEY` no longer auto-creates an OpenAI text provider; it is only used for TTS (`gpt-4o-mini-tts`), never for text generation unless explicitly configured
- **Async Terminal Events** -- Replaced blocking `crossterm::event::poll()` with async `EventStream` + `tokio::select!` to prevent TUI freezes during I/O-heavy operations

### Fixed
- **Model Contamination** -- `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` was causing GPT-4 to be used for text instead of Anthropic Claude; multi-layered fix across factory, env overrides, and TTS key sourcing
- **Navigation Slowdown** -- TUI became sluggish after losing terminal focus due to synchronous 100ms blocking poll in async context
- **Context Showing 0%** -- Loading an existing session showed 0% context; now estimates tokens from message content until real API usage arrives
- **Approval Spam** -- "edit_file -- approved" messages no longer clutter the chat; approved tool calls are silently removed since the tool group already shows execution progress
- **6 Clippy Warnings** -- Fixed collapsible_if (5) and manual_find (1) across onboarding and telegram modules

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Telegram Bot Integration** -- Chat with OpenCrabs via Telegram alongside the TUI; bot runs as a background task with full tool access (file ops, search, bash, etc.)
- **Telegram Allowlist** -- Only allowlisted Telegram user IDs can interact; `/start` command shows your ID for easy setup
- **Telegram Markdown→HTML** -- Agent responses are formatted as Telegram-safe HTML with code blocks, inline code, bold, and italic support
- **Telegram Message Splitting** -- Long responses automatically split at 4096-char Telegram limit, breaking at newlines
- **Grouped Tool Calls** -- Multiple tool calls in a single agent turn now display as a collapsible group with tree lines (├─ └─) instead of individual messages
- **Claude Code-Style Approval** -- Tool approval dialog rewritten as vertical selector with `❯ Yes / Always / No` matching Claude Code's UX
- **Emergency Compaction Retry** -- If the LLM provider returns "prompt too long", automatically compact context and retry instead of failing

### Changed
- **Token Estimation** -- Changed from `chars/4` to `chars/3` for more conservative estimation, preventing context overflows that the old estimate missed
- **Compaction Accounts for Tools** -- Auto-compaction threshold now reserves ~500 tokens per registered tool for schema overhead, preventing "prompt too long" errors
- **Telegram Feature Default** -- `telegram` feature now included in default features (no need for `--features telegram`)

### Fixed
- **Context % Showing 2369%** -- `context_usage_percent()` was summing all historical token counts; now uses only the latest response's `input_tokens`
- **TUI Lag After First Request** -- `active_tool_group` wasn't cleaned up on error/abort paths, causing UI to hang
- **Telegram Bot No Response** -- Bot was calling `send_message` (no tools) instead of `send_message_with_tools`; also needed `auto_approve_tools: true` since there's no TUI for approval

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Context Usage Indicator** -- Input box shows live `Context: X%` with color coding: green (<60%), yellow (60-80%), red (>80%) so you always know how close you are to the context limit
- **Auto-Compaction** -- When context usage exceeds 80%, automatically sends conversation to the LLM for a structured breakdown summary (Current Task, Key Decisions, Files Modified, Current State, Important Context, Errors & Solutions), saves to MEMORY.md, and trims context keeping the last 8 messages + summary for seamless continuation
- **`/compact` Command** -- Manually trigger context compaction at any time via slash command
- **Brave Search Tool** -- Real-time web search via Brave Search API (set `BRAVE_API_KEY`); great if you already have a Brave API key or want a free-tier option
- **EXA Search Tool** -- Neural-powered web search via EXA AI; works out of the box via free hosted MCP endpoint (no API key needed). Set `EXA_API_KEY` for direct API access with higher rate limits

### Changed
- **EXA Always Available** -- EXA search registers unconditionally via free MCP endpoint; Brave still requires `BRAVE_API_KEY`

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Inline Tool Progress** -- Tool executions now show inline in chat with human-readable descriptions (e.g. "Read src/main.rs", "bash: cargo check", "Edited src/app.rs") instead of invisible spinner
- **Expand/Collapse Tool Details** -- Press Ctrl+O to expand or collapse tool output details on completion messages, inspired by Claude Code's UX
- **Abort Processing** -- Press Escape twice within 3 seconds to cancel an in-progress agent request via CancellationToken
- **Active Input During Processing** -- Input box stays active with cursor visible while agent is processing; border remains steel blue
- **Processing Guard** -- Prevents sending a second message while one is already processing; shows "Please wait or press Esc x2 to abort"
- **Progress Callback System** -- New `ProgressCallback` / `ProgressEvent` architecture emitting `Thinking`, `ToolStarted`, and `ToolCompleted` events from agent service to TUI
- **LLM-Controlled Bash Timeout** -- Bash tool now accepts `timeout_secs` from the LLM (capped at 600s), default raised from 30s to 120s

### Changed
- **Silent Auto-Approved Tools** -- Auto-approved tool calls no longer spam the chat; only completion descriptions shown
- **Approval Never Times Out** -- Tool approval requests wait indefinitely until the user acts (no more 5-minute timeout)
- **Approval UI De-Emojified** -- All emojis removed from approval rendering; clean text-only UI
- **Yolo Mode Always Visible** -- All three approval tiers (Allow once, Allow all session, Yolo mode) always visible with color-coding (green/yellow/red) in inline approval

### Fixed
- **Race Condition on Double Send** -- Added `is_processing` guard in `send_message()` preventing overlapping agent requests

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Inline Tool Approval** — Tool permission requests now render inline in chat instead of a blocking overlay dialog, with three options: Allow once, Allow all for this task, Allow all moving forward
- **`/approve` Command** — Resets tool approval policy back to "always ask"
- **Word Deletion** — Ctrl+Backspace and Alt+Backspace delete the last word in input
- **Scroll Support** — Arrow keys and Page Up/Down now scroll Help, Sessions, and Settings screens
- **Tool Approval Docs** — README section documenting inline approval keybindings and options

### Changed
- **Ctrl+C Behavior** — First press clears input, second press within 3 seconds quits (was immediate quit)
- **Help Screen** — Redesigned as 2-column layout filling full terminal width instead of narrow single column
- **Status Bar Removed** — Bottom status bar eliminated for cleaner UI; mode info shown in header only
- **Ctrl+H Removed** — Help shortcut removed (use `/help` instead); fixes Ctrl+Backspace conflict where terminals send Ctrl+H for Ctrl+Backspace

### Removed
- **MCP Module** — Deleted empty placeholder `src/mcp/` directory (unused stubs, zero functionality)
- **Overlay Approval Dialog** — Replaced by inline approval in chat
- **Bottom Status Bar** — Removed entirely for more screen space

### Added
- **Anthropic OAuth Support** — Claude Max / setup-token authentication via `ANTHROPIC_MAX_SETUP_TOKEN` with automatic `sk-ant-oat` prefix detection, `Authorization: Bearer` header, and `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` header
- **Claude 4.x Models** — Support for `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with updated pricing and context windows
