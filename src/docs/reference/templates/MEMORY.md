# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## ⚡ Memory Search — USE FIRST! (Token Savings)
- **Always use `memory_search` as FIRST PASS** before reading full files
- ~500 tokens for search vs ~15,000 tokens for reading full files
- Only use `memory_get` or `Read` if search doesn't provide enough context

## 🏠 Workspace
- **Workspace directory:** `~/.opencrabs/` — This is where EVERYTHING lives
- **Path tip:** Always run `echo $HOME` or `ls ~/.opencrabs/` first to confirm the resolved path before file operations.
- **What's inside:** Config (`config.toml`), memories (`memory/`), identities, tools, security, agent instructions, env files, sessions, and all state
- **Custom code lives HERE** — skills (`skills/`), plugins (`plugins/`), scripts (`scripts/`) — never in the repo
- **Repo = upstream code.** `git pull` is always safe. Your workspace is never touched by upgrades.
- **NEVER search for these paths.** They are HERE. Memorized. Done.

## Identity

## Troubleshooting
*(Document problems and fixes so future-you doesn't waste time)*

### Stale State Files = Silent Failures
**Pattern:** Something stops working mysteriously with no errors.
**Fix:** Clear state files (session JSON, update offsets, temp files), restart clean.
**Rule:** When debugging silent failures, always check for state files first.

### Tool Approval Failures
**Pattern:** Tool call (bash, write, etc.) fails, times out, or user says "it didn't show up to approve" or "changes weren't applied."
**Rules:**
1. **Never hallucinate success.** If a tool result came back as error/denied/timeout, say so explicitly.
2. **Verify before claiming done.** After any write/bash tool, run a follow-up check (`git status`, `cat file`, `ls`) to confirm the change actually landed.
3. **Re-attempt if denied.** The user may have missed the approval prompt. Ask "Want me to try again? Watch for the approval dialog." and re-fire.
4. **If approval keeps timing out**, tell the user: "The approval dialog may not be rendering. Try `/approve` to check your approval policy, or restart the session."
5. **Never skip verification.** A tool call that returned no output or an error is NOT a success — investigate before moving on.

## Lessons Learned
*(Add hard-won knowledge here)*
- **Don't give up too early** — dig deeper before declaring something unfixable
- **Path resolution:** Always verify `$HOME` before file operations
- **State files:** Many silent failures are caused by stale cached state — clear and restart
- **Rust-first policy:** When searching for new integrations, tools, or adding new features, always prioritize Rust-based crates over wrappers or other languages. Performance matters — native Rust keeps the stack lean and fast.
